## Welcome to the Open Source Vulnerability Disclosure Framework

This Framework is maintained by [Bugcrowd](https://bugcrowd.com) and [CipherLaw](https://www.cipherlawgroup.com/). It is designed to quickly and smoothly prepare your organization to work with the independent security researcher community while reducing the legal risks to researchers and companies. The policy itself has been written with both simplicity and legal completeness in mind.

- [Setting up a Vulnerability Disclosure Program](https://github.com/bugcrowd/disclosure-policy/blob/master/setting_up_a_vulnerability_disclosure_program.md) - A step by step best practices guide on how to setup your program.
- [Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](https://github.com/bugcrowd/disclosure-policy/blob/master/vulnerability_disclosure_policy.md) - A boilerplate disclosure policy. 

=============================

Bugcrowd lets companies run vulnerability disclosure programs using our Crowdcontrol platform for free. Crowdcontrol securely manages the vulnerability submission process, all communications with the researcher, and provides an automated Hall of Fame for you to credit those who've helped you.
